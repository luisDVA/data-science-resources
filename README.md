## Adding a resource

* Please make a pull request with an edit to the `resources.csv` file. 
* Ensure all three columns are complete.
  * `Type`: valid options are `Blog`, `Book`, `Newsletter`, `Website`, `Community`, `Data`, `Challenge`, `Video`, or `Podcast`. If a resource fits into multiple `Type` categories, please choose the one that fits best. 
  * `Name`: the name of the resource e.g. Who's blog is it? Or what is the name of the book?
  * `Link`: the full URL to the resource. Links should be to the main resource page e.g. link to a blog rather than a single blog post, or a YouTube channel rather than a single video.
